# 🧠 AI Engineering Foundations — Core Python Projects

Welcome! This repository contains **hands-on Python projects** I've built as part of my journey to become an **AI Engineer**. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using **only core Python**, without relying on external libraries. The goal is to master the fundamentals that power more advanced AI systems.

> 🚀 5 Projects Completed — More Coming Soon as I Continue My Learning Journey...

## 🔍 Why Only Core Python?

Understanding the **"how it works under the hood"** is essential before relying on tools like pandas, spaCy, or scikit-learn. These projects help build:

- 🧠 Strong logical thinking
- 🛠️ Manual data handling skills
- 📝 Regex and text processing expertise
- 🔁 Problem-solving confidence

## 🧭 What's Next?

I'm continuously expanding this repository by building:
- ✅ Core AI utilities (done ✅)
- 🔤 NLP utilities using custom Python
- 📈 Manual ML algorithms (from scratch)
- 🤖 Full AI project pipelines
- 🗃️ DSA-based Python utilities for optimization

> 🌱 I'm committed to lifelong learning. This will grow as I evolve in my AI engineering path — one project at a time.
