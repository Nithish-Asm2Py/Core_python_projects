# 🧠 AI Engineering Foundations — Core Python Projects

Welcome! This repository contains **hands-on Python projects** I've built as part of my journey to become an **AI Engineer**. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using **only core Python**, without relying on external libraries. The goal is to master the fundamentals that power more advanced AI systems.

> 🚀 5 Projects Completed — More Coming Soon as I Continue My Learning Journey...


## 📦 Projects Completed

Project Name                     |    Description
<!-- # |----------------------------------------------------------------------------||------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # -->
| 📸 **Image Metadata Reader**    | Extracts EXIF metadata (camera, date, GPS) from image files using `os` & `datetime` |
| 🧠 **Keyword Entity Extractor** | Extracts keywords/entities from text based on patterns and string logic         |
| 📚 **Plagiarism Checker**       | Compares two text files and calculates similarity using basic string matching    |
| 🧾 **Resume Extractor**         | Extracts name, email, phone, and skills from resumes using regex and file parsing|
| 📊 **CSV Data Cleaner**         | Loads and cleans CSV data manually without pandas — handles missing/null values  |

Each project is inside its own folder with a self-contained `README.md`, source code, and sample files.

## 🔍 Why Only Core Python?

Understanding the **"how it works under the hood"** is essential before relying on tools like pandas, spaCy, or scikit-learn. These projects help build:

- 🧠 Strong logical thinking
- 🛠️ Manual data handling skills
- 📝 Regex and text processing expertise
- 🔁 Problem-solving confidence

## 🧭 What's Next?

I'm continuously expanding this repository by building:
- ✅ Core AI utilities (done ✅)
- 🔤 NLP utilities using custom Python
- 📈 Manual ML algorithms (from scratch)
- 🤖 Full AI project pipelines
- 🗃️ DSA-based Python utilities for optimization

> 🌱 I'm committed to lifelong learning. This repository will grow as I evolve in my AI engineering path — one project at a time.
